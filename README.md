Each one can be used with the § symbol or the & symbol. The vanilla method of formatting the codes above is the § symbol. Bukkit Plugins usually use &.
 
These are the official vanilla colors. 🪐 But, since 1.17+, Mojang added Hex Coloring, with the §x format. Example with FF0000:
`§x§f§f§0§0§0§0`...

## Mini Message
Mini Message, or in the Minecraft development area most known as Kyori, is a library maintained by the @PaperMC team, adding Components to Minecraft and a new way to use colors.

MiniMessage is a simple string representation of chat components, originally made by MiniDigger in April 2020. MiniMessage goal is to make JSON messages in Minecraft easier to use, while maintaining the JSON style. Kyori is a independant library, MiniMessage API is mostly used for PaperMC API Plugins. Also widely used all over the community.
