## Minecraft Vanilla Colors

Minecraft features a total of 17 color codes and additional formatting codes for **bold**, **italics**, and **underlines**. These colors range from **Black** to **White**.

![Color_table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tweeny-Community/roblox-mc-utils/refs/heads/main/assets/learning/Minecraft_Formatting.webp)

Apply these color codes with the `§` symbol, followed by the corresponding character or number (for example, §f, §4, §0). In some cases, if the color cannot be applied with the `§` symbol, use the `&` symbol instead. 

Minecraft supports custom colors since 1.16, which can be useful for servers. Apply a custom hex color with the `§f§f§0§0§0§0` format.
