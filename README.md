## Minecraft Vanilla Colors.

Minecraft features a total of 17 color codes and additional formatting codes for bold, italics, and underlines. These colors range from **Black** to **White.**

Apply these color codes with the `§` symbol, followed by the correct following character or number e.g., §f, §4, §0. In some cases, if the color cannot be applied with the `§` symbol, use the `&` symbol instead. 

Minecraft allows you to create custom hex colors since 1.16. These can be useful for servers. Apply a custom hex color with the `§f§f§0§0§0§0` format.
